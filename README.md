# MatlabRaspy

This is a repository for the 2023 Mathworks Student Ambassador Project:
Connecting MATLAB with Raspberry PI to control a 3D printed Robotic arm.

A guide can be found in the [Raspberry PI Robot Arm with MATLAB Workshop Guide](./Raspberry%20PI%20Robot%20Arm%20with%20MATLAB%20Workshop%20Guide.pdf)

## The files you need to run the project are:

**robotArm.m** --> All functionalities there, just run the robotArm.m file using r = robotArm;
This will create a robot object that tries to connect to the real connected robot. 

**Workshop.mlx** (located in Workshop_Student folder) --> This is the workshop livescript

*Note:* The functions folder needs to be added on the MATLAB PATH (usually done automatically in the scripts)
